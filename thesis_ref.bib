It takes into account information about network, user terminal and user preferences. This information is gathered together by means of MPEG-21 DIA descriptors. The optimal adaptation option is achieved through the application of the Viterbi algorithm. The results prove that the presented decision-taking engine offers an optimal and efficient solution for personalized scalable video adaptation in heterogeneous environments.},

One such example is the Robotics field, where sensors are used to capture information about the surrounding environment, allowing the system to react to changes. But also in the multimedia communications field, some work has recently emerged to allow combining sensed context and use that combined information to decide how to adapt the content. This paper describes the MULTICAO ontology, which lies at the core of an Adaptation Decision Engine, providing it with a formal description of the surrounding environment in a similar way as humans would describe it. This way the system has higher chances to take adaptation decisions that best meet users' expectations.},

abstract = {Image adaptation, one of the essential problems in adaptive content delivery for universal access, has been actively explored for some time. Most existing approaches have focused on generic adaptation towards saving file size under constraints in client environment and hardly paid attention to user's perception on the adapted result. Meanwhile, the major limitation on the user's delivery context is moving from data volume (or time-to-wait) to screen size because of the galloping development of hardware technologies. In this paper, we propose a novel method for adapting images based on user attention. A generic and extensible image attention model is introduced based on three attributes (region of interest, attention value, and minimal perceptible size) associated with each attention object. An algorithm is developed to find the optimal adaptation efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed scheme and its potential application in the future.},

New display technologies, such as AMOLED, have been recently introduced to smartphones to fulfill the requirements of these multimedia applications. However, as an AMOLED screen's power consumption is determined by the display content, such applications are often limited by the battery life of the device they are running on, inspiring many researches to develop new power management schemes. In this work, we evaluate the power consumption of several applications on a series of Samsung smartphones and take a deep look into AMOLED's power consumption and its relative contributions for multimedia apps. We improve AMOLED power analysis by considering the dynamic factors in displaying, and analyze the individual factors affecting power consumption when streaming video, playing a video game, and recording video via a device's built-in camera. Our detailed measurements refine the power analysis of smartphones and reveal some interesting perspectives regarding the power consumption of AMOLED displays in multimedia applications.},

abstract = {Mobile devices provide a variety of ways to access information resources available on the Web and a high level of adaptability to different aspects of the context (such as the device capabilities, the network QoS, the user preferences, and the location) is strongly required in this scenario. In this paper, we present a rule-based approach supporting the automatic adaptation of content delivery in Web Information Systems. The approach relies on the general notions of profile and configuration. The former is used to model a variety of context characteristics in a uniform way. The latter describes, in abstract terms, how to build the various levels of a suitable Web interface (content, navigation and presentation). We propose an original notion of adaptation rule that can be used to specify, in a declarative way, how to build a configuration that satisfies the requirements of adaptation for a profile. The evaluation process defined for these rules supports: (1) the handling of many separately specified adaptation requirements according to different aspects of the context, possibly not fixed in advance, and (2) their integration into one coherent recipe for adaptation. We also describe the architecture and functionality of a prototype implementing the proposed approach and illustrate experimental results supporting its flexibility and efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {In many application scenarios, the use of Regions of Interest (ROIs) within video sequences is a useful concept. It is shown in this paper how Flexible Macroblock Ordering (FMO), defined in H.264/AVC as an error resilience tool, can be used for the coding arbitrary-shaped ROIs. In order to exploit the coding of ROIs in an H.264/AVC bitstream, a description-driven content adaptation framework is introduced that is able to extract the ROIs of a given bitstream. The results of a series of tests indicate that the ROI extraction process significantly reduces the bit rate of the bitstreams and increases the decoding speed. In case of a fixed camera and a static background, the impact of this reduction on the visual quality of the video sequence is negligible. Regarding the adaptation framework itself, it is shown that in all cases, the framework operates in real time and that it is suited for streaming scenarios by design.},

abstract = {Recently, HTTP streaming has become very popular for delivering video over the Internet. For adaptivity, a provider should generate multiple versions of a video as well as the related metadata. Various adaptation methods have been proposed to support a streaming client in coping with strong bandwidth variations. However, most of existing methods target at constant bitrate (CBR) videos only. In this paper, we present a new method for quality adaptation in on-demand streaming of variable bitrate (VBR) videos. To cope with strong variations of VBR bitrate, we use a local average bitrate as the representative bitrate of a version. A buffer-based algorithm is then proposed to conservatively adapt video quality. Through experiments, we show that our method can provide quality stability as well as buffer stability even under very strong variations of bandwidth and video bitrates.},

abstract = {Devices, standards and software develop rapidly, but still often independently of each other. This creates problems in terms of content suitability on various devices. Also, in mobile environment, user and system-level applications must execute subject to a variety of resource constraints. In order to deal with these constraints, content adaptation is required. In this chapter, we justify the need of distributed cross media content adaptation and the potential of utilizing Web Services as the adaptation providers. We introduce request-driven context to complement constraint-driven and utility-driven approaches. We describe the request context mapping and propose a novel path's determination scheme for determining the optimal service proxies to facilitate the adaptation tasks. To better illustrate the disjoint portions in content passing between service proxies, two communication models were associated. Then, within Web Services, we explain the related protocols and socket connection between adaptation's services. We conclude with discussion regarding the strengths of the proposed architecture.},

abstract = {Three different advanced adaptation techniques for improving the video perception of users are proposed in this paper. The proposed techniques exploit different adaptation decision-taking and adaptation approaches to adapt particular core parameters while considering diverse contextual information and constraints to achieve improved video perception of users. The first proposed technique employs a utility-based adaptation approach to perform adaptation operations on spatial resolution, frame rate, and quality scalability parameters according to the content-related contextual information (i.e., motion activity and structural feature) while fulfilling network bandwidth and terminal display size constraints. Using this technique, video contents can be adapted with the scalability parameters best fitting users' and contextual constraints' needs to achieve improved video perception. The second technique relies on prioritizing key frame, non-key frame, and temporal layer parameter-related network abstraction layer units to adapt video contents to satisfy network bandwidth constraint. The rate-distortion performances of adapted video contents can be improved by utilizing this technique in adaptation operations both in terms of bit rate of adapted video contents and video perception of users. The third technique is based on adapting the bit rate of 3-D video contents according to the changes in ambient illumination of the viewing environment. The adaptation results evaluated by either subjective or objective quality assessment techniques prove that all of the proposed techniques are efficient to improve the video perception of users.},

abstract = {The full degree of freedom in mobile systems heavily depends on the energy provided by the mobile phone's batteries. Their capacity is in general limited and for sure not keeping pace as the mobile devices are crammed up with new functionalities. The discrepancy of Moore's law, offering twice the processing power at least each second year, and the development in batteries, which did not even double over the last decade, makes a shift in researchers' way of designing networks, protocols, and the mobile device itself. The bottleneck to take care of in the design process of mobile systems is not only the wireless data rate, but even more the energy limitation as the customers ask for new energy-hungry services, e.g., requiring faster connections or even multiple air interfaces, and longer standby or operational times of their mobile devices at the same time. In this survey, the energy consuming entities of a mobile device such as wireless air interfaces, display, mp3 player and others are measured and compared. The presented measurement results allow the reader to understand what the energy hungry parts of a mobile device are and use those findings for the design of future mobile protocols and applications. All results presented in this work and further results are made public on our web page [2].},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel method for content adaptation and video summarization fully implemented in compressed-domain. Firstly, summarization of generic videos is modeled as the process of extracted human objects under various activities/events. Accordingly, frames are classified into five categories via fuzzy decision including shot changes (cut and gradual transitions), motion activities (camera motion and object motion) and others by using two inter-frame measurements. Secondly, human objects are detected using Haar-like features. With the detected human objects and attained frame categories, activity levels for each frame are determined to adapt with video contents. Continuous frames belonging to same category are grouped to form one activity entry as content of interest (COI) which will convert the original video into a series of activities. An overall adjustable quota is used to control the size of generated summarization for efficient streaming purpose. Upon this quota, the frames selected for summarization are determined by evenly sampling the accumulated activity levels for content adaptation. Quantitative evaluations have proved the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach, which provides a more flexible and general solution for this topic as domain-specific tasks such as accurate recognition of objects can be avoided. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {With the heterogeneous proliferation of mobile devices, the delivery of learning materials on such devices becomes subject to more and more requirements. Personalized learning content adaptation, therefore, becomes increasingly important to meet the diverse needs imposed by devices, users, usage contexts, and infrastructure. Historical server logs offer a wealth of information on hardware capabilities, learners' preferences, and network conditions, which can be utilized to respond to a new user request with the personalized learning content created from a previous similar request. In this paper, we propose a Personalized Learning Content Adaptation Mechanism (PLCAM), which applies data mining techniques, including clustering and decision tree approaches, to efficiently manage a large number of historical learners' requests. The proposed method will intelligently and directly deliver proper personalized learning content with higher fidelity from the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM)-compliant Learning Object Repository (LOR) by means of the proposed adaptation decision and content synthesis processes. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate that it is efficient and is expected to prove beneficial to learners.},

abstract = {Understanding the energy consumption of a smartphone application is a key area of interest for end users, as well as application and system software developers. Previous work has only been able to provide limited information concerning the energy consumption of individual applications because of limited access to underlying hardware and system software. The energy consumption of a smartphone application is, therefore, often estimated with low accuracy and granularity. In this paper, we propose AppScope, an Android-based energy metering system. This system monitors application's hardware usage at the kernel level and accurately estimates energy consumption. AppScope is implemented as a kernel module and uses an event-driven monitoring method that generates low overhead and provides high accuracy. The evaluation results indicate that AppScope accurately estimates the energy consumption of Android applications expending approximately 35mW and 2.1{\%} in power consumption and CPU utilization overhead, respectively.},

Also, as a common scene, video users are always chasing popular video clips. In this paper, we apply video popularity as a spontaneous label to distinguish different video clips. Moreover, we associate video popularity with video quality, thus facilitating video users in pursuing video clips with both satisfying video popularity and video quality. We first apply evolutionary game to model the video clip selection process, and then propose a Q-learning based algorithm.},

abstract = {Wireless multimedia traffic has increased considerably in recent years, and it has become urgent to propose new approaches to deliver multimedia application in an energy-efficient manner. In wireless networks, observations show that some multimedia streams requested by users in a certain geographical area for a certain period exhibit very similar behavior. By exploiting the similarity, we can significantly reduce power consumption in wireless cellular networks. In this article, we present the description of user behavior in HCN and then propose an architecture for multimedia transmission over HCN. Based on this architecture, an energy-efficient multimedia transmission scheme is proposed to optimize energy efficiency by exploiting user behavior. In this scheme macrocells and small cells cooperatively multicast/unicast multimedia steams without QoS degradation. Illustrative results indicate that the exploitation of user behavior and base station cooperation is able to bring green multimedia transmission for HCN.},
